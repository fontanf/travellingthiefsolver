# Travelling thief solver

A solver for various problems related to the travelling thief problem:
* The travelling thief problem
* The packing while travelling problem
* The travelling while packing problem
* The thief orienteering problem

This code was originally developped for the [GECCO 2023 Travelling Thief Problem Competition](https://sites.google.com/view/ttp-gecco2023/home).

## Implemented algorithms

### Travelling thief problem

* Tree search (dynamic programming) implemented with [fontanf/treesearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/treesearchsolver) `-a tree-search`
  * Exact algorithm, for very small problems (~10 cities)

* Local search implemented with the sequencing module from [fontanf/localsearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/localsearchsolver) `-a local-search`
  * Returns very good solutions but only practical for small problems (< 100 cities)

* Efficient local search implemented with [fontanf/localsearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/localsearchsolver) (but not using the sequecing module) `-a efficient-genetic-local-search`
  * Returns good solutions for medium problems (< 1000 cities)

* Iterative TSP PWT TTP `-a iterative-tsp-pwt-ttp`
  * Returns good solutions for large problems (< 10000 cities)

* Iterative TSP PWT `-a iterative-tsp-pwt`
  * Quickly returns solutions for very large problems (> 10000 cities)

### Packing while travelling problem

* Dynamic programming `-a dynamic-programming`
  * Exact algorithm, for small problems

* Sequential value correction `-a sequential-value-correction`
  * Very fast, a few seconds for very large problems
  * Works well when the capacity constraint is active

* Efficient local search `-a efficient-local-search`
  * Fast, about a hundred seconds for very large problems
  * Works well when the capacity constraint is not active

### Travelling while packing problem

* Local search implemented with the sequencing module from [fontanf/localsearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/localsearchsolver) `-a local-search`

### Thief orienteering problem

* Tree search (dynamic programming) implemented with [fontanf/treesearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/treesearchsolver) `-a tree-search`
  * Exact algorithm, for very small problems (~10 cities)

* Local search implemented with the sequencing module from [fontanf/localsearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/localsearchsolver) `-a local-search`
  * Returns very good solutions but only practical for small problems (< 100 cities)
